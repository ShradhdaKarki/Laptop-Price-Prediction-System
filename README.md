# Laptop-Price-Prediction-System | Machine Learning End to End Project | Heroku Deployment

This end to end pipeline will consist of following steps:

1. Understanding the problem statement: 
   For this project we will use dataset containing different Laptop information like Brand, Memory, GPU,       Screen resolution and so on. The required output of the model is that it should be able to predict the pricing of the laptop based on the attributes given by user. 
   
2. Acquiring the required data: 
 
3. Understanding the data:
  Data consist of single columns consisting of multiple information. Lot of **feature engineerin**g eas required
  
4. Cleaning the data

5. Selecting the best model for training: 

    **Algorithms used: Linear regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression , KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradiant Boost, Adaboost, Xgboost**

6. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters

7. Presenting the results

8. Deploying in Heroku

Final Output:
